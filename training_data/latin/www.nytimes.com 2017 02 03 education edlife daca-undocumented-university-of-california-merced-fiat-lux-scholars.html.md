Creating a Safe Space for California Dreamers
=============================================

By [PATRICIA LEIGH

The [University of California,
Merced](http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_california/index.html?inline=nyt-org),
rises apparition-like out of a landscape of cow pastures, cotton fields
and grasslands. In the cool of the morning, the faint scent of manure,
the olfactory signature of the Central Valley, hangs in the air.

The campus is meant to evoke this rural setting. The crop-colored yellow
and gold exterior of Tenaya Hall is set off by corrugated metal accents
— touches reminiscent of the silos and the fields in which so many of
the students’ parents work. Tenaya Hall is home to the Fiat Lux
Scholars, a special initiative for first-generation, low-income students
that is named for the University of California’s motto, “Let There Be
Light.”

The Merced campus opened in 2005; with just 7,000 students (it’s slated
to expand by 2020 to 10,000) it does not yet possess the critical mass
necessary to support a Gap, a Shake Shack, a Starbucks or other
college-town amenities. And so it remains of the Valley — a place of
poverty, hit hard by the
[foreclosure](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier)
crisis, in which an aspiration gap plays out in underperforming schools;
only about 13 percent of Merced County residents have a bachelor’s
degree.

The university’s mission has been to change that equation. About 70
percent of the student body are the first in their families to attend
college, and roughly 5 percent are undocumented immigrants.

The Fiat Lux program, established in 2010, is designed to reach these
students, the ones who grew up sleeping on living room floors so the
bedrooms could be rented out, or who learned how to rub garlic on the
bottoms of shoes to ward off snakes while crossing the desert. The idea
is to provide a pedagogical and social armature to help them navigate
college, especially the pivotal first year that research shows is the
strongest predictor of college success.

And so as freshmen, 175 of the scholars, 22 of them undocumented, live
together on the upper two floors of Tenaya Hall, sharing sparsely
decorated rooms reflective of their modest means — a graduation watch
here, a pair of Huaraches there.

One of them is Aurora Fabian. On the wall of her bunk bed in Room 351C
there is a thumb-tacked quote she takes to heart: “Happy People Shine
Brighter!” Like her peers who entered the country illegally, Ms. Fabian
always tries to shine bright. Her path from Mexico to this campus was
hard won. From fifth grade onward, she was out until almost midnight
helping her single mother mop, sweep and clean the counters of a bakery
before moving on to scrub the tile floors of a nearby Italian
restaurant.

Through it all, she managed to play high school soccer, run
cross-country, work summers and weekends on the Santa Cruz boardwalk.
Determined to “change our family history,” as she puts it, Ms. Fabian
won two local scholarships and a coveted spot at the University of
California.

Collectively, the freshmen in Tenaya Hall are the beacons of a better
life. They are the sons and daughters of housekeepers, dishwashers,
fast-food cooks, farm laborers, landscapers, garment workers who stitch
labels onto clothing and contractors who build swimming pools for
affluent homeowners along the coast.

Francisco Gavidia in Room 470C fled the violence in El Salvador,
sleeping on his grandmother’s dirt floor until he could join his
parents, whom he knew only through photos and phone calls. He remembers
an incident growing up in East Los Angeles in which his mother, who
worked below minimum wage, took him to the E.R. with a bloody nose and
was handed a bill for $3,000. “I felt really bad,” he said, jiggling his
leg as he recalled it. “It was just a bloody nose and it was really
expensive.”

Cruzangel Nava in Room 450G, a political science major, grew up in a
part of
[Coachella](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/coachella_valley_music_and_arts_festival/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier)
light years away from the eponymous music festival. The family lost
their two-story home to foreclosure during the recession; Mr. Nava, then
in seventh grade, watched in stunned silence as his parents sold off the
family’s two cars, his toys, his bike, his game system and his clothes —
his father’s hand-embroidered poncho hanging in his dorm room a
cherished exception. “They told me they were selling to people who
didn’t have things,” he said.

Juan Robles in Room 451A saved up money for college by picking plums
alongside his mother, who raised three children by rising at 4:30 a.m.
six days a week to work in the fields. A champion debater, Mr. Robles is
easy to spot in his jacket, tie and matching silk pocket handkerchief, a
sartorial foreshadowing of his career goal to be a legislator crafting
“small policies that can make a big difference in someone’s life.” It’s
a difference he knows first hand.

Theirs is the \#undocupower generation.

Many of Tenaya’s undocumented come from so-called mixed-status families,
with siblings born in the United States. Karen Gomez, a sophomore who
serves as a peer counselor, tried to stifle the envy she felt being left
behind during summers while a younger sister traveled to Mexico,
including to their grandmother’s funeral. “She’d say little ungrateful
things about going,” she said. “I’d think, ‘Don’t you realize how lucky
you are?’ ” Her sister, now a junior in high school, will be eligible
for scholarships that her big sister cannot apply for. A model peer
counselor, Ms. Gomez tapes safe sex pamphlets, free condoms and other
necessities of college life on her door.

Living together as a cohort is meant to foster bonding, and to ease
first-generation students into the larger community. It is also an
approach strongly associated with student retention; Fiat Lux Scholars
graduate at a higher rate than students with comparable grade-point
averages. Those accepted into the program — there is a waiting list —
attend numerous workshops aimed at what is called procedural knowledge,
boning up on study skills and learning how to connect with professors
and research opportunities. Several times a semester there are organized
lunches with faculty members.

Many come to college never having met a professor, notes Tanya
Golash-Boza, a sociology professor. “Some come into my office literally
shaking.”

Ms. Golash-Boza recently completed a study of 35 undocumented Merced
students and found that 22 of their families earned less than $25,000 a
year, on par with the average for undocumented students across the
University of California’s 10 campuses. Financial pressure is
considerable, she said, but because of Merced’s first-generation
majority, students feel less isolated. “These students understand not
being able to afford lunch,” she said. “There’s no shame associated with
being poor here.”

Charles Nies, the vice chancellor of student affairs, was a
first-generation, low-income student himself. The guiding premise, he
said, is to “create an environment where these students matter.”

Many in Tenaya Hall grew up having to keep their status a secret, a
heavy psychic burden. Madely Martinez, a biology major, remembers hiding
from vigilantes after being dropped off in the desert by a blue truck,
having to lie flat and still as fire ants crawled all over her. The
scene would repeat itself in recurring childhood nightmares. “I was
always afraid,” she said. “I thought that even my friends might call the
cops.”

For Ms. Martinez, the opportunity to live among smart young people who
grew up in similarly fraught circumstances felt like a chrysalis
breaking open — the butterfly the apt symbol of the immigrant rights
movement.

“You don’t have to hide the person you are,” she explained, sitting amid
miscellaneous stuffed turtles and under a poster for the Dance
Coalition, the campus performing troupe she belongs to. “Coming here, I
realize I’m not the only person who has these fears.”

She is among thousands of students around the country who are attending
college largely because of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known
as DACA. The directive, established in 2012 by executive action,
provides work authorization and a temporary reprieve from deportation
for so-called Dreamers (derived from failed legislation called
Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors), who entered the
country illegally as children. While undocumented students are
ineligible for federal financial aid, including loans, with DACA they
can take jobs and graduate teaching assistantships to help defray the
cost of their education.

The directive is distinct from most immigration policies in placing
educational attainment front and center, with a high school diploma a
key requirement. DACA recipients — there are more than 750,000
nationally — tend to be an accomplished bunch: Nearly 15 percent are
pursuing a master’s degree or higher, according to a 2016 national
survey, and 28 percent are studying STEM, making it the most popular
major. Because they can renew their DACA status every two years, many
have leveraged their education into careers in their chosen fields.

On the morning of Nov. 9, the study lounge on Tenaya’s fourth floor
filled with students in their pajamas calling their parents through
tears. “I couldn’t hold my composure,” recalled Cruzangel Nava. “I
completely broke down.” Many students, fearing the potential deportation
of their parents, headed home to keep them close.

“There was a lot of anxiety,” said Ms. Gomez, the peer counselor.
“People wanted to be with their families.”

Donald J. Trump campaigned on the vow that he would send the
undocumented home and terminate DACA, calling the executive action that
created it illegal and unconstitutional. On DACA, he has softened his
tone. In the president’s first week in office, a spokesman said that Mr.
Trump would work with Congress for “a long-term solution on that issue,”
and instead focus on deporting those with criminal records.

But Mr. Trump has taken forceful action against immigrants, closing the
borders to refugees and ordering his wall with Mexico. His choice for
attorney general, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, has been a consistent and
vociferous critic of both illegal and legal immigration, and has tried
several times to pass laws abolishing DACA. What the president has in
mind for DACA is an open question.

Students feel particularly vulnerable because applying for DACA means
handing over personal information to the United States Citizenship and
Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland Security. It is
impossible to slough off anti-immigration sentiment and plans for walls
when your very own family members are “the illegals.”

Alejandro Delgadillo, associate director of the Calvin E. Bright Success
Center at Merced, which has a “safe space” for undocumented students,
has been trying to calm nerves. The university had sent notices around
in December urging DACA students studying abroad to come home well
before Jan. 20 to avoid possible detention at the border. It likewise
has advised those planning to study abroad to stay put. A “know your
rights” legal workshop is set for early this month.

“We’ve always told our students to take advantage of the opportunities
they have here at the university,” said Mr. Delgadillo, who has worked
with unauthorized students for 25 years. “I can be reassuring,” he said.
“But for the first time in my professional career, I can’t tell them not
to fear.”

Diana Peña, the U.C. system’s full-time mental health provider for
undocumented students, based at Berkeley, said her caseload has nearly
doubled since the election. Students have had difficulty sleeping and
taking tests or complain of “headaches and stomach aches having to do
with the way the body absorbs stress,” she said. These symptoms, she
said, have been exacerbated by discriminatory comments on social media.

“The lives of these students are very fragile,” said Marcelo M.
Suárez-Orozco, dean of the graduate school of education at the
University of California at Los Angeles and an author of a national
study in 2015 of undocumented undergraduates. They have spent their
formative years in a “labyrinth of liminality,” he said. “They play
Little League, they sell lemonade, they join the Boy and Girl Scouts.
And then one day they learn: By the way, you’re not an American.”

The study found “breathtaking levels of anxiety,” with clinical stress
levels four times higher for young women and seven times higher for
young men than the norm. Respondents also reported feeling isolated on
campus, uncertain about whom they could trust.

DACA has given these goal-oriented young people the opportunity to plan
and imagine a future for themselves, Dr. Suárez-Orozco said. They now
find themselves in a “horrific Kafka-like situation” in which they have
potentially outed their parents to federal authorities. “What young
people crave more than anything else is a sense of belonging,” he added.
“Now they are going back to a deep crisis of uncertainty. This is a
seismic shift.”

Francisco Mascorro Montes — Kiko to his friends — keeps rosaries from
his Mexican grandmother beside his bed in Tenaya Hall, an emblem of his
faith. A mechanical engineering major, he is a member of Ingenieros
Unidos, a student chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional
Engineers. He earned money for books and a laptop by operating a
peach-sorting machine last summer.

“Any fear I have is for my parents,” he said. “I know the university has
our backs.”

Indeed, in contrast to South Carolina and Alabama, which prohibit
undocumented students from receiving in-state tuition, and Georgia,
which prevents them from attending three top public universities,
California has a formidable array of state laws and university policies
designed to support them.

The state has the most DACA recipients in the country — about a third of
the total — and they benefit from in-state tuition rates and access to
financial aid under the California Dream Act ($1,670 for community
colleges to a maximum of $12,294 for the University of California).

It was Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California, who
developed DACA as secretary of Homeland Security under President Obama.
Her appointment was at first controversial because of her enforcement of
deportations. But early in her tenure as university president, she
started a $5 million fund that pays for advisers like Mr. Delgadillo and
resource centers on each campus, where undocumented students can receive
academic, career and financial aid advice. Last year, her office
allocated $8.4 million, much of it for a universitywide revolving “Dream
Loan” fund.

Ms. Napolitano has taken a strong stance defending the civil rights of
her system’s roughly 3,800 undocumented students, including stating
publicly that the university would not comply with any national registry
based on race, religion or national origin. She and heads of the state’s
two other public university systems wrote a joint letter to Mr. Trump in
support of DACA students.

California itself is poised to push back against the Trump
administration. The Democratic-led legislature recently retained Eric H.
Holder Jr., attorney general under President Obama, to represent them in
any legal fights against the new Republican White House. Lawmakers have
also pledged to enact legislation that would provide free legal help for
immigrants facing deportation proceedings. Unauthorized children now
receive Medi-Cal, state public health insurance for low-income
residents, and Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill, awaiting a federal
waiver, to allow undocumented immigrants to access the benefits of the
Affordable Care Act (should it survive).

Nevertheless, educators and immigration lawyers are operating on the
assumption that DACA is in jeopardy, even as they keep a watchful eye on
the Bridge Act, co-authored by Senators Richard J. Durbin and Lindsey
Graham, a potential lifeline that would extend benefits for three years
if DACA is revoked and toughen confidentiality protections.

Allison Davenport, a staff lawyer at the Immigrant Legal Resource
Center, has been meeting with students at the Dream Success Center at
California State University, Fresno. Like many of her colleagues, she is
advising first-timers who have yet to apply for DACA to hold off. They
risk turning over their personal data with potentially no return. She
has been up and down Highway 99, the spine of the Central Valley,
conferring on family preparedness plans, including “What will happen if
someone is detained?” and “Who are your emergency contacts at school?”

Advocates and administrators throughout California say they have
observed pronounced signs of unsettledness. At California State, some
undocumented students have been asking if they should drop out, others
are limiting their time in public spaces; in the Long Beach Community
College District, which has a large Cambodian population, students
appear to be changing addresses without leaving forwarding information;
applications for state financial aid are down by one-third compared with
the same period last year. “Parents are afraid the information will not
stay within the state,” said Lupita Cortez Alcalá, the executive
director of the California Student Aid Commission.

If DACA goes, of course, the ability to work legally goes with it, along
with any health insurance an employer might provide and, in some states,
driver’s licenses and in-state tuition.

Raul Z. Moreno, coordinator of the Dream Outreach Center at California
State, Fresno, said that graduates who either didn’t apply or did not
qualify for DACA have been creatively cooking up career paths that do
not require work authorization — the undocumented music teacher teaching
at-risk students outside of school, the computer scientist who sets up
shop repairing and selling cellular phones. “It depends on their special
talent and academic preparation,” he said. “Unfortunately, this doesn’t
use their full potential. Ideally, the system allows them to be who they
want to become.”

Along with hot plates and minifridges, resilience and tenacity are
staples of Tenaya Hall. In rooms grouped by sixes down long corridors,
young people who spent their winter vacations cutting other peoples’
grass and cleaning other peoples’ floors try hard to study and party,
and pretend everything is normal.

Rosalba Zavaleta, Aurora Fabian’s roommate in 351C, is confident that
whatever happens with DACA, she will be fine; her concern is for her
sister Faviola, who grew up with juvenile arthritis, unable to walk. The
disease, with which she still struggles, was the impetus for the
family’s journey from Mexico. A state program for low-income children
with severe medical conditions paid for her surgeries.

“I don’t mind washing dishes,” Ms. Zavaleta said of the prospect of
being deported. “But what’s going to happen to my sister?”

Cruzangel Nava, who is set on being a district attorney, would turn to
farm labor and landscaping. “They don’t care who does that work as long
as the work gets done,” he said, adding that being sent back to a
country he doesn’t know “is like an animal in a cage being put into the
wild.”

Ms. Gomez, whose mother is a hotel housekeeper, grew up in the cramped
confines of farmworker housing. Some days, the family didn’t have enough
to eat. On her desk at Merced, she keeps a picture of her high school
graduation. She wears a cap and gown with a gold sash (for highest
honors), a black sash (for student body president), a blue sash (for
secretary of the community service organization) and a gold medal (for
achievement in Advanced Placement calculus). “It shows me that if I made
my parents proud that day, then I can continue when I graduate,” she
said. She goes back to that photograph every single day.
