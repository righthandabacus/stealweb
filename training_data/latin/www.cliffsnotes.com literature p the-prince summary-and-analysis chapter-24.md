Summary and Analysis Chapter 24
-------------------------------

If a new prince follows all of these principles, he will soon be as
secure as a hereditary ruler, because if people find they are doing well
in the present, they will not look for changes. But anyone who acquires
a new state and then loses it through incompetence is disgraced. The
Italian rulers who have lost their states did so because they lacked
military power, made their subjects hate them, or were unable to defend
against the nobles. They should not blame bad luck but their own
laziness for their losses, because they did not make preparations, and
when trouble struck, they ran away, hoping the people would restore
them. A prince can only rely on defenses that he can personally control.

This chapter brings Machiavelli back to his discussion of Italy's
political situation in his time, which he last treated in his discussion
of military matters in Chapters 12 through 14. He specifically mentions
the King of Naples and the Duke of Milan as rulers who have lost their
power, but he is most concerned with Ludovico Sforza, whom Machiavelli
regarded with contempt. Sforza provided a perfect example of how not to
follow Machiavelli's precepts. He encouraged Charles VIII of France to
invade Italy, and when Louis XII returned, the French deprived Sforza of
his state and made him their prisoner. Machiavelli blamed him for many
of Italy's troubles resulting from the foreign invasions. Frederick of
Aragon (1452-1504), the King of Naples, is probably less fair as an
example, because he was forced out of power by a secret agreement
between Louis XII and Ferdinand II to divide Naples between them. In the
face of two major powers, there was very little Frederick could have
done to preserve his position.

In particular, Machiavelli has harsh words for the laziness and
indolence of the Italian princes, because an ideal prince must always be
planning and maneuvering to avoid future disasters. Finally, Machiavelli
returns to his theme of self-sufficiency: Relying on others is always a
mistake, because others are out of your control. Only by controlling
your own resources can you be really secure. Machiavelli takes up this
theme more fully in Chapter 25.

**Philip of Macedon** Philip V (238-179 B.C.), king of Macedon. He was
defeated in 197 B.C. by Titus Quintus Flaminius, a Roman general, at
Cynoscephalae.

A prince risks being despised if he does all but which of the following?

I saw mention of *haversack* in my history book. What does that word mean?
