Summary and Analysis Chapters 1-2
---------------------------------

There are two types of states: republics and principalities. Machiavelli
declares that he will not discuss republics, examining only how
principalities may be acquired and governed. Principalities are
inherited or new.

New principalities are either annexed to a ruler's existing territory or
are completely new. New principalities are either used to being ruled by
a prince or are used to being free. New principalities are acquired by
luck or by strength.

Hereditary principalities, which are used to being ruled by the prince's
family, are easy to maintain, because tradition keeps the prince's
position stable as long as he does not make himself hated.

In Chapter 1, Machiavelli traces the basic outlines of a discussion that
will take him through Chapter 11: the different types of states, how to
acquire them, and the difficulties they present to a ruler. Machiavelli
refers to republics, which are governed by their citizens, and
principalities or princely states, which are governed by a single,
strong ruler (a prince). Because he is addressing one of those princes,
he avoids any discussion of republican government, except to note that
republics conquered by a new prince are used to living free, a theme he
returns to in later chapters. In many of his other works, Machiavelli
passionately defended republican forms of government, and he suffered
for his defense of the Florentine republic which the Medici now ruled.

Hereditary principalities are those in which rule is passed down among
members of one family. Machiavelli considers these the easiest to govern
and therefore disposes of the subject by observing that any minimally
competent prince can hold onto one. At the end of Chapter 2, Machiavelli
makes the first of his many observations about human nature, noting that
people are inclined to forget that even old established governments were
innovations once.

**Milan/Sforza** Francesco Sforza (1401-1466) became Duke of Milan in
1450. (See the List of Characters.)

**Naples/King of Spain** Ferdinand (1452-1516) had originally agreed to
divide the Italian kingdom of Naples with Louis XII of France, but
Ferdinand drove out the French forces and took over Naples in 1503.

**Duke of Ferrara** actually two dukes, Ercole d'Este (1431-1505), who
lost territory to the Venetians in 1484, and his successor, Alfonso
d'Este (1476-1534), who managed to stay in power despite the opposition
of three different popes. The d'Este family had ruled Ferrara for almost
four centuries.
